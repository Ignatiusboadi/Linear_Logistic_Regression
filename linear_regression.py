class LinearRegression:
    """
    This class provides functionality for training a linear regression model on a features matrix
    and target vector using gradient descent optimization. It supports both batch gradient descent
    and stochastic gradient descent. The user can specify  the number of epochs, the learning rate
    for the algorithm and beta, if they want to apply momentum.

    Attributes
    -----------
    x: np.ndarray
        outputs the features matrix to be used in training the linear regression model.
    y: np.ndarray
        outputs the target vector to be used in training the linear regression model.
    epochs: int
        outputs the number of epochs set to run in the implementation of the gradient descent algorithm.
    lr: float
        outputs the learning rate used (to be used) in the algorithm.
    batch: int
        number of datasets to be used for each iteration in training the model. An output of None indicates batch
        gradient descent was used; 1 indicates stochastic gradient descent algorithm was implemented.
    beta: float
        outputs the value for beta (momentum) used.
    weights: np.ndarray
        outputs the weights determined from the implementation of the gradient descent algorithm.
    losses: np.ndarray
        outputs the average loss for each epoch from the implementation of the gradient descent algorithm.

    Methods
    --------
    fit:
        implements the gradient descent algorithm using the given features matrix and target vector to find
        the best weights.
    make_prediction:
        makes prediction using a given features matrix and the weights determined from the Gradient descent
        algorithm.
    loss_function:
        computes the loss using given weights, a feature matrix and a target vector.
    grad_function:
        computes the gradient of the loss using given weights, a feature matrix and a target vector.
    plot_function:
        plots the graphs of the target vector against one column feature matrix, and the predicted y value against
        the one column feature matrix.
    r_square:
        computes the r-square on the training set if no data is passed. When a dataset is passed,
        makes a prediction using x and the weights, then computes the r-square.
