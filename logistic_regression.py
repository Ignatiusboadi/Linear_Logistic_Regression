class LogisticRegression:
    """
    This class provides functionality for training a logistic regression model
    on labeled binary classification data using gradient descent optimization.
    It supports both batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent.
    The user can specify  the number of epochs, the learning rate for the
    algorithm and beta, if they want to apply momentum.

    Attributes
    ----------
    x: np.ndarray
        outputs the features matrix to be used in training the linear regression model.
    y: np.ndarray
        outputs the target vector to be used in training the linear regression model.
    epochs: int
        outputs the number of epochs set to run in the implementation of the gradient descent algorithm.
    lr: float
        outputs the learning rate used (to be used) in the algorithm.
    batch: int
        number of datasets to be used for each iteration in training the model. An output of None indicates batch
        gradient descent was used; 1 indicates stochastic gradient descent algorithm was implemented.
    beta: float
        outputs the value for beta (momentum) used.
    weights: np.ndarray
        outputs the weights determined from the implementation of the gradient descent algorithm.
    losses: np.ndarray
        outputs the average loss for each epoch from the implementation of the gradient descent algorithm.

    Methods
    --------
    add_ones:
        adds a column of ones to the feature matrix to account for the intercept.
    sigmoid:
        computes the sigmoid function for the given features matrix.
    predict:
        classifies predictions from the sigmoid function into appropriate class using a threshold of 0.5.
    cross_entropy:
        computes the loss for a given weights. Used in gradient descent algorithm to compute weights.
    grad_function:
        gradient of cross entropy. Used in gradient descent algorithm to compute weights.
    fit:
        implements gradient descent algorithm using inputs to determine best weights. Also changes loss attribute
        of the object.
    accuracy:
        computes the level of accuracy for the predictor on given features matrix and target vector.
        Multiplying output by 100 gives accuracy in percentages.
